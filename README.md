# Test-particle  
This code trace the trayectory of energetic particles in the Radiation belts. The method used is described in Fok, M.-C., and T. E. Moore. 1997. "Ring current modeling in a realistic magnetic field configuration." Geophys Res Lett, 24: 1775-1778 [10.1029/97GL01255]

The original test-particle code was written in fortran by Fok, M.-C. and colaborators. This project convert the original code to python and improve the visualitation and analysis of the data.
