# Test-particle  
This code trace the trayectory of energetic particles in the Radiation belts. The method used is described in 
##### Fok, M.-C., and T. E. Moore. 1997. "Ring current modeling in a realistic magnetic field configuration." Geophys Res Lett, 24: 1775-1778 [10.1029/97GL01255]

The original test-particle code was written in fortran by Fok, M.-C. and colaborators. This project convert the original code to python and improve the visualitation and analysis of the data. 

Also it is possible to trce the trayectory of particle with non $90^o$ pitch angles
